<h2>Using StarUML to Generate ActionScript 3.0</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.staruml.com">StarUML</a> is a free,
	Windows-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML</a> tool
	used for creating diagrams related to application design.
	There are many different kinds of diagrams that UML support, but our focus
	here will be on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram">Class Diagrams</a>.
	Class diagrams represent the structure of a collection of classes by showing
	both how they're defined (inheritance hierarchy) and how they relate to one
	another (associations).</p>
<p>By creating a class diagram before you even begin writing a single line of
	code, you can place focus on one of the more important aspects of an application,
	it's interface and design. Once you have that defined, implementation becomes
	a lot simpler and smoother to incorporate. Additionally, UML can be used
	to create class skeleton files for you. Most UML tools, including StarUML,
	support an export to a programming language's source code.</p>
<p>StarUML can export to a number of different programming languages out of the
	box but does not support ActionScript natively. Instead, a custom export
	script is required to supply that functionality. This tutorial will cover
	the use of StarUML to export UML class diagrams to ActionScript 3.0
source code using a custom export script.<br />
</p>
<h3 id="usingtheactionscript30export">Using the ActionScript 3.0 Export</h3>
<h4 id="installation">Installation</h4>
<p>Export the <kbd>ActionScript 3.0</kbd> folder into:</p>
<p><kbd>&lt;StarUML  install&gt;\modules\staruml-generator\templates</kbd></p>
<p>which with a standard Windows installation would be:</p>
<p><kbd>C:\Program Files\StarUML\modules\staruml-generator\templates</kbd></p>
<p>The ActionScript 3.0 folder contains two files: <kbd>template description.tdf</kbd>,
	a description file providing basic information specific to the export, and
	<kbd>template.cot</kbd>, the template script used to generate the source code.
	This should result in the following file locations:</p>
<p><kbd>C:\Program Files\StarUML\modules\staruml-generator\templates\ActionScript
	3.0\template description.tdf</kbd><br />
	<kbd>C:\Program Files\StarUML\modules\staruml-generator\templates\ActionScript
3.0\template.cot</kbd></p>
<p> With these files in place, StarUML will be able to recognize the ActionScript
	3.0 export as a valid export option; no restart is required.</p>
<h4 id="use">Use</h4>
<p>Once you've installed the necessary template files, you access
	the export your UML to ActionScript 3.0 through the StarUML Generator dialog.
	To open this dialog, use:
	<kbd>Tools &gt; StarUML Generator&#8230;</kbd>. </p>
<p><img src="images/staruml_generator.jpg" width="501" height="360" /></p>
<p>This dialog reads the available
	.tdf files in the templates directory and displays them in a list. The ActionScript
	3.0 template should be listed with a Document Name of &quot;ActionScript 3.0&quot;.
	Check that template and hit Next.</p>
<p><img src="images/select_path.jpg" width="501" height="360" /></p>
<p>Select the directory you want to export the ActionScript, then hit Next.</p>
<p><img src="images/generating.jpg" width="501" height="360" /></p>
<p>The results screen will open. Click Generate to begin the export and hit Finish
	when the export is complete.</p>
<h3 id="umltoactionscripttranslations">UML to ActionScript Translations</h3>
<p>The following outlines how UML objects and relationships in StarUML translates
	to ActionScript when exported from StarUML using the ActionScript 3.0 export
	template. The behavior of many of these translations can be controlled through
	preferences.</p>

<h3 id="preferences">Preferences</h3>
<p>The ActionScript 3.0 export template includes a number of user-definable preferences
that help determine what is exported and how. You can access these preferences
	in the StarUML Generator dialog.</p>
<p><img src="images/template_properties.jpg" width="501" height="360" /></p>
<p>The preferences specific to the ActionScript 3.0 export template include:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Multiple Source Files</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Creates a separate file for each source file. The directory
structure will be based on the package location of each definition. If a folder
matching the package path does not exist, one is created.<br />
<strong>unchecked</strong>: Places all source code in the default output file. The name of this
file will be output.log unless changed within the Template Properties dialog
in StarUML.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Indent Style</dt>
	<dd><strong>tab</strong>: [Default] Indents using the tab character.<br />
	<strong>space</strong>: Indents using space characters. The number of spaces
	used is determined by <dfn>Space Indent Size</dfn>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Space Indent Size</dt>
	<dd><strong>[Any Number]</strong>: [Default = 4] When <dfn>Indent Style</dfn> is
		set to &quot;space&quot;,
	this number determines the number of spaces to use for indention.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Indent After Package Block</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Indents the definition block following
	the package block.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: Does not indent the definition block. Some styles
	prefer not indenting this block.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Use ANSI Indentation</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: Uses ANSI-style indention which places opening brackets ({) on a new
	line starting at the same column as the previous.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: [Default] Uses Kernel Normal Form indention style
	where opening brackets ({) are placed at the end of a line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Auto-name Unnamed Associations</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Automatically create and name properties for associations
	without names. Names will simply become their types with a lowercase first letter.
	For example, if an unnamed association references a Loader class, the name of
	the member variable in the class on the other end of the association will be &quot;loader&quot;.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: Unnamed associations will be ignored and no variable
	will be created.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Public Attributes as Getter/Setters</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Converts public attributes into a getter/setter
		pair of that name which return and set a private version of that variable.
		The name of the private variable is based off of the <dfn>Auto-generated Getter/Setter
		Prefix</dfn> and <dfn>Auto-generated Getter/Setter Suffix</dfn> preferences.
		It is often considered good programming practice to avoid public member
		variables.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: Public attributes are defined as public member variables.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Auto-generated Getter/Setter Prefix</dt>
	<dd><strong>[Any String]</strong>: [Default = &quot;_&quot;] Determines a prefix
		for a generated, private member variable that is being used with getter/setter
		functions defined when <dfn>Public Attributes as Getter/Setters</dfn> is checked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Auto-generated Getter/Setter Suffix</dt>
	<dd><strong>[Any String]</strong>: [Default = &quot;&quot;] Determines a suffix
		for a generated, private member variable that is being used with getter/setter
		functions defined when <dfn>Public Attributes as Getter/Setters</dfn> is checked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Ignore Definitions Named with Package</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] If a class or other definition is given
		a name with a package path or otherwise contains a period (.), it will
		not be included in the source export. This allows you to specify native
		classes in UML (i.e. flash.display.MovieClip) and not have those classes
		exported with your custom classes. Note: for top level classes like Object
		or Array, just add a period to the beginning of the class name, e.g.
		.Object and .Array.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: Classes with periods in their names will be exported.
	Their names will be resolved as package paths.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Import Types Named with Package</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] If the text specifying a type for an
		attribute or operator contains a package path or otherwise contains a
		period (.), the type will resolve to its class name only and an import for
		its class will be added to the top of the class file.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: Types with periods will not be modified in the source
	code. No imports will be included.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Auto-generate Constructors</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Creates constructors automatically if a constructor is not
	specified as an operation. If an operation has the same name as it's class name,
	it is considered a constructor.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: Will not create constructors automatically if not
	defined operation. This usually isn't a problem unless a superclass requires
	constructor arguments at which point a constructor is required to call super()
	with those arguments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Include Empty Supers</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: Includes calls to super() in constructors even when there are no parameters
	for super. This can be considered superfluous given that it will be automatically
	added if not present, but some prefer their use.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: [Default] Calls to super() are not added to constructors if super
	requires no parameters. If a call to super does require parameters (the super
	class constructor requires parameters), that will be added.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Set Attributes in Constructors</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Compares the attributes defined within
		the class and the parameters passed into the constructor. If a constructor
		parameter's name matches a class attribute, a definition is set within
		the constructor to set the class attribute to the value of the parameter
		argument. To prevent naming conflicts, <dfn>Set Attributes Prefix</dfn> and <dfn>Set
		Attributes Suffix</dfn> is used.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: Attributes are not set in constructors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Set Attributes Prefix</dt>
	<dd><strong>[Any String]</strong>: [Default = &quot;this.&quot;] Determines
		a prefix for a class attribute that is being set to a constructor parameter
		as a result of the <dfn>Set Attributes in Constructors</dfn> preference. This
		will usually either be &quot;this.&quot; or match <dfn>Auto-generated Getter/Setter
		Prefix</dfn>. This is necessary since  <dfn>Set Attributes in Constructors</dfn> relies
		on parameters and attributes of the same name. Without some sort of distinction
		between the two, a parameter might just end up setting itself to itself
		rather than the class's member variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Set Attributes Suffix</dt>
	<dd><strong>[Any String]</strong>: [Default = &quot;&quot;] Determines
		a suffix for a class attribute that is being set to a constructor parameter
		as a result of the <dfn>Set Attributes in Constructors</dfn> preference. This
		will usually match <dfn>Auto-generated Getter/Setter
	suffix</dfn>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Auto-instantiate Compositions</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Composition association members are
		instantiated in the class. When defined, parameter names are used in
		composition class instantiations match that class's constructor parameters.
		It is likely you will need to modify these further given that instances
		are created in the class body along with variable declarations.<br />
<strong>unchecked</strong>: Composite association members are not automatically
instantiated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Auto-generate Methods from Interfaces</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Automatically creates method declarations in classes if missing
	in the operation list but required by an interface in which the class implements.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: Will not automatically create methods for you requiring
	that you implement them yourself in order to make the class compile. In some
	cases using false may be necessary if you are inheriting from a class that is
	not defined in the UML that provides the necessary implementation. The export
	script will not be able to determine that your class will have access to that
	implementation making methods that would need to be deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Signals Extend Event</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Any Signal class in UML that does not
		directly extend (through a Generalization) another class will automatically
		extend flash.events.Event.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: Signals without superclasses will not extend anything.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Include Event clone</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Automatically includes a clone method
		in Event classes.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: No clone method is included.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Include Event toString</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Automatically includes a toString method
		in Event classes.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: No toString method is included.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Raisers Extend EventDispatcher</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Any  class that has an operation that
		raises a non-exception signal and does not directly extend (through a
		Generalization) another class will automatically extend flash.events.EventDispatcher.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: Classes without superclasses that raise signals
	will not extend anything.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Raisers Include dispatchEvent</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Adds a call to dispatchEvent in operations
		that raise Signal (Event) objects.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: No dispatchEvent call is included.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Include Event Metadata</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Automatically includes an Event metadata
		tag for the class for raised events. The event type specified is the name of
		the Signal class with a lowercase first letter.<br />
	<strong>unchecked</strong>: Event metadata is not included.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Event Metadata Style</dt>
	<dd><strong>flash</strong>: [Default] If <dfn>Include Event Metadata</dfn> is
		true, the  metadata added is in the form of <code>[Event(&quot;<ins>&lt;name&gt;</ins>&quot;)]</code>.<br />
	<strong>flex</strong>: If <dfn>Include Event Metadata</dfn> is true, the metadata
	added is in the form of <code>[Event(name=&quot;<ins>&lt;name&gt;</ins>&quot;, type=&quot;<ins>&lt;type&gt;</ins>&quot;)]</code>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Exceptions Extend Error</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Any Exception class in UML that does
		not directly extend (through a Generalization) another class will automatically
		extend Error.<br />
		<strong>unchecked</strong>: Exceptions without superclasses will not extend
		anything.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Raisers Include throw</dt>
	<dd><strong>checked</strong>: [Default] Adds a throw statement in operations
		that raise Exceptions (Error) objects.<br />
		<strong>unchecked</strong>: No throw statement is included.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If at any time you want to change the defaults for these values, you can do
	so from the StarUML Generator dialog by pressing the Template Properties
	button.</p>

<h3 id="exportresults">Export Results</h3>
<p>When an export is completed, the results of that export are placed in a file
	named <kbd>output.log</kbd> (the name of this file can be changed in the template
	preferences). If the preference <dfn>Multiple
	Source Files</dfn> is unchecked, it will also contain all the source code generated
	from the UML.</p>
<p>Results include what objects were traversed in the UML structure for source
	code consideration and whether or not source code was produced. If produced,
	any warnings or errors that occurred are also listed. It would be common
	to see warnings, but errors should not occur and would usually imply a bug in
	the export template. An example results log might include something like
	the following:</p>
<pre>com: No output.
 
domain: No output. 
 
Generating source code code for com.domain.Bars...
Source code for com.domain.Bars successfully created!
 
Generating source code code for com.domain.Car...
WARNING: Unnamed association of type Engine found; creating default variable name.
WARNING: Unimplemented interface method drive; auto-generating.
WARNING: Return type not found for brake; assuming void.
Source code for com.stuff.Car successfully created!</pre>
<h3 id="warnings">Warnings</h3>
<p>Many warnings can be prevented with the correct definitions in UML. Other
	warnings, however, simply indicate that action must be taken to make the
	generated code usable. These are specific to certain preferences. For example,
	with <dfn>Auto-instantiate Compositions</dfn> checked, no assumptions are made
	as to what values are being used for the constructor parameters of the new
	instances. This creates a warning because the code may need to be edited
	to include the appropriate values.</p>
<p>The  list of possible warnings are as follows:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Unnamed association of type [TYPE] found; (creating default variable name
		| ignoring).</dt>
	<dd>This means an association connected one class to another but no name was
		provided for that association. If <dfn>Auto-name Unnamed Associations</dfn> is
		checked, a default name will be created for you. If unchecked, the association
		will be ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Return type not found for [OPERATION]; assuming void.</dt>
	<dd>If you do not define a return type in the parameters list of an operation,
		this warning will be issued. Operations without return types will generate
		methods whose return types are void.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Unimplemented interface method [OPERATION]; (auto-generating | you will
	need to define this method yourself).</dt>
	<dd>Indicates an interface was being implemented by a class which did not implement
		all required methods defined within that interface. When <dfn>Auto-generate
		Methods from Interfaces</dfn> is
		checked, these methods will be automatically generated. Otherwise the
	warning will indicate that you will need to do this yourself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>No constructor available for [CLASS] when a call to super with 
	arguments is required.</dt>
	<dd>This warning occurs if a class inherits from another class with required
		constructor parameters and no constructor was available to call super
		with  arguments for those parameters. This circumstance will only occur
		when <dfn>Auto-generate Constructors</dfn> is unchecked.</dd>

<p>You'll notice that the flash.display.Sprite and flash.display.Loader
	classes were not exported to ActionScript. Naturally you wouldn't expect
	files generated for these classes since they are native Flash Player classes.
	But how does the export know not to? It uses their names. Because the class
	names are defined with their full package paths, those classes are omitted
	from the export. This is governed through the <dfn>Ignore Definitions Named
with Package</dfn> preference.</p>
